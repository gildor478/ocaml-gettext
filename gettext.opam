synopsis: "Internationalization library (i18n)"
description:"""
This library enables string translation in OCaml. The API is based on GNU
gettext. It comes with a tool to extract strings which need to be translated
from OCaml source files.

This enables OCaml program to output string in the native language of
the user, if a corresponding translation file of the English strings is
provided.
