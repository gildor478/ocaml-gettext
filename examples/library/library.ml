  (* Two simple examples : singular translation *)
  print_endline (s_ "Hello world!");

  (* More complicated : plural translation, using strings *)

  (* More simple forms of plural translation, using printf *)

(* Another example function: used by program.ml *)
let hello_you name = Printf.printf (f_ "Hello %s\n") name
